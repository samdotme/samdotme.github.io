In business, entrepreneurs learn by running into problems and then solving those problems. In academia, students learn by being told the solutions to hundreds of problems without knowing the problems themselves.

Both learning approaches work. But one is significantly faster than the other.

The danger of the "learn by running into problems" approach is that you don't immediately gain a deep knowledge of the subject. Did you know that Steve Jobs never learned to code?

The danger of the "learn by exposure to general solutions" approach is that once you've finished your general education, you still have to learn by running into problems if you want to do anything useful. Ask any computer science graduate about their first year of job experience.

If you are an 18-year-old wanting to enter the technology field, getting a general exposure to problems is probably a good idea. If you are a 35-year-old, wanting to build the next killer app, you often do not have the time to take the slower approach. First, because your life circumstances (family, hobbies, investments) have become full of responsibilities that require you to make money consistently, which gives you less time. Second, because the market is moving too fast. If you wait two years to learn generalities, the market will have moved beyond you.

The biggest reason that people choose the "learn by exposure to general solutions" approach is that it's less emotionally taxing. Classroom environments carefully prevent you from being exposed to information you haven't been exposed to yet. Real world environments on the other hand deliver information to you without restraints. This means that you are constantly exposed to feelings of insecurity.

The key is to redefine the emotions you get from your experiences. For example, most people are terrified of being laughed at in public, but standup comics live for this. So when you begin learning something new, decide the following: "Feeling overwhelmed means that I finally found information I can learn. Not being able to get something to work usually means that I've researched 10 different approaches that didn't work this time but I will be able to use in the future."

The other piece is that you need to trust your brain's latent capabilities. Our brains are able to do a significant amount of learning when they are exposed to new terms for which we do not yet have a mental framework for. If you can keep your brain from shutting down, it will quietly file away the many information blasts you encounter as you enter a new field. You will find that without conscious work, you have built a mental framework for the new field. Usually you suddenly discover this while having a technical conversation and realizing you finally have something intelligent to say.

If you are a traditional software developer in 2024, you are about to undergo a significant learning journey these next 5 years. If you don't, you may need to find another line of work. Decide to enjoy the process.
