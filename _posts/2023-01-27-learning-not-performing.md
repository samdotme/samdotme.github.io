Each of us has a gift, which we tend to devalue because it comes easy to us, while we look at the gifts of others and wish they were ours.

> “And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.” - [King Solomon](https://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/ECC+4.html)

## The comparison trap

In software this manifests as us comparing ourself to the “Alpha Dev” who can compare and contrast three hashing algorithms for any situtation. This leads us to trying to play catch up to their knowledge instead of experimenting and growing our own knowledge.

Knowledge was made to be acquired via play, hands-on experimenting (kids and baby animals know this instinctively). Yet most of the world, as it grows up, enters classrooms where all human distinctions are cut away and the only thing which matters is time to mastery of the single subject being studied. By the time we graduate college, this way of thinking is so engrained into us, we don’t even know there are other options.

We join a team. We watch the tech lead. We see their PR submissions and wonder how could we ever achieve their breadth of knowledge. Over time, we copy them and indeed begin to look a bit like them. Eventually, they get a better job offer, and we take their job, the cycle begins again, with us resetting our sites on the next person ahead of us in knowledge. Until we get disillusioned and settle in for whatever we’ve achieved and ride out our careers to retirement.

## KPI and GPA?

We tend to build our performance around how we measure ourselves, which is just the set of measurements others give to us. Often these are 3 letter words like KPI and GPA.

I once attended a quarterly meeting in another city. In the first meeting, a spreadsheet was displayed on a projector to evaluate how our team had performed. The sheet looked familiar, I couldn't place it at first, and then I did. I had seen this sheet about 3 months ago. Someone had emailed it to us, we'd taken a look and then our priorities shifted and we forgot about it like so many other such spreadsheets that had passed our way before. 

But over the next 4 days, our team was grilled line by line on our progress for a set of measurements we had no idea we were being measured on.

I've noticed that when someone leaves a company, we often talk about achievements which never reflected on their quarterly goal sheets. Here are the things which often come up:

- Long-forgotten pet projects that they pioneered.
- Whether people felt engergized and empowered by them.
- Their standards of excellence.

Sometimes we focus too much on the metrics in front of us, but we need to remember that there's another set of metrics which matter more.
