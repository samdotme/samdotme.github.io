Hey! Are you a developer wanting to make the jump into building apps on top of AI?

I'm not talking about using Github Copilot or Chat GPT to code. I assume you are already doing that.

What I'm talking about is starting to build real apps that leverage AI to do things that previously weren't possible when you all you had was a model/view/controller architecture.

We've entered a new age of computing. This isn't the first time developers have had to deal with this. Imagine you were an assembly code programmer when procedural languages started to come out. Imagine you were a C programmer when object oriented concepts took off. Imagine you were building UIs in Java when web UX became a thing.

In every new age, there remain opportunities to do things the old way for quite some time. I'm sure you can find a few assembly programmers at IBM. You can still definitely find C programmers in the embedded space. Even Java UIs are still around. But the future is not created by the people who stay in the old space. It's created by those who make the jump.

Many people think "AI is the next big thing" or that "AI will replace all traditional developers." This is not entirely true. AI is to traditional programming what object-oriented programming was to procedural programming. It allows us to build things in a faster way and it unlocks new kinds of apps that were previously impossible. And most importantly, it requires those who make the jump to change the way they think about problems.

And that's what I'm here to help you with. I'm not a PhD in Machine Learning. I'm a software developer who spent hours on Pluralsight and YouTube tutorials just like you did. I learned every aspect of building modern apps and got good at a few of those aspects.

In all honesty, I'm not that far ahead of you in my AI journey (or maybe you're further than me). I'm not yet to a place where I can take you deep into fine tuning convolutional neural network architectures. But I can help you make the first jump. That's all you really need. Once you do that, your natural learning abilities will kick in.

There was a day when you didn't know how to code, and then there was a day when you did. There was a day when you couldn't explain the difference between the stack and the heap, and then the day came when you could. There was a day when you suddenly understood that API calls were a secret magic that allowed you to talk between systems.

Today you stand before the next jump that's required for you to move from the world of traditional apps to the world of new apps unlocked by AI functionality.

I want to help you get over the threshold between the code-based era and the AI-based era. I want you to be hit by the "aha" moments that will allow you to begin building the apps you never thought were possible. Once you get your feet on the ground, I know you can make it the rest of the way.

I'm building a course that will help you make the jump: https://llm.samschneider.me/llm-expert-masterclass-where-to-start
