  I was 29 and having to leave a career I'd invested the past 7 years into. My background was English literature. I prayed and felt like I heard "look into web development".
</p>

<p>
  Now I'm 37, and coming up on 8 years of professional software development. I'm halfway through a Master's in Computer Science, and I'm getting to work on cutting-edge systems I never dreamed someone like me would ever get to touch.

  You can too.
