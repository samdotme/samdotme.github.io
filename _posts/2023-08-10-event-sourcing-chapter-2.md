I pull into the parking lot at 12:14. Still haven't found the package and I'm sure having 4 people searching full time is going to kill our other numbers for the day. But there's not a lot more I can do, and I promised Lily I'd keep our lunch appointment. 

Ever since we've been married, Lily has always been the one to keep up our friendships. It seems like we do lunch or dinner with someone at least once a week. Of course, with her job at the college, networking is probably more important than with what I do. Not that I think she's really networking. She just cares about people.

As I start walking through the door I can smell roasted lamb from somewhere back in the restaurant. This was a smart appointment to keep. But suddenly realize I can't remember who we're meeting. I think Lily said he was a professor in Europe or something. Since she teaches in the business school, he must have something to do with that. 

I see Lily at the back of the restaurant. She puts up a hand and I acknowledge it. I see a middle aged man sitting across from her that looks like he trains for ultra-marathons or something. I sit down next to Lily and she motions to our guest.

"Ben, do you remember Adil?"

Whew, I dodged a bullet on forgetting his name, and actually, yes I do remember Adil. He and his wife and toddler spent Christmas afternoon at our house several years ago.

"Hi, Adil," I say, "You're looking fantastic."

He smiles and points to the menu, "We've already ordered for you. Lily said you would be in a hurry to get back to work today."

How does she read me over the phone? Well, she probably already knew I wanted the lamb shwarma.

"Yeah," I say, "we've had a lot of shipments get lost recently. Every time it happens it leads to mountains of paperwork and root cause analysis meetings for me."

"Interesting," he says. "I assume you have an advanced computer system for tracking these things."

"Yes, we do," I reply. "It was state of the art 15 years ago, and we still pay a mountain of cash every year to some consultants to keep it running on a recent version."

"So you think you're employees are not trained correctly?" he asks.

"We have a comprehensive training program. I review it each year to make sure it still covers our main operations."

The food is already coming out. Lily knows how to order food. Talk turns to Adil's family, then to ours. I glance at my watch. I need to be getting back to the office.

"One more question about your work Bill," Adil says.

"Do you consider your warehouse as primarily stationary objects or primarily moving objects?"

"Well, if you go in there pretty much everything is just sitting there on the shelves except for a few things being picked and packed. So I guess stationary."

"How you make money?" Adil asks.

"By shipping things out on time," I say.

"So your data primarily tracks stationary objects, but the only thing you really care about from a business perspective is when the objects move," he says.

"I guess that's right," I reply. I'm almost curious enough to ask more, but being late back to the warehouse wouldn't look good with a lost package.

I stand up. "Sorry guys," I've got to go. "Bring your wife and daughter next time Adil, we'd love to have you for Christmas again."

When I get back to the warehouse parking lot it's 12:58. There's a brand new Tesla in the parking lot that's not mine and none of our employees make enough to buy one. I make my way through the front doors and toward my office and I see through the window that someone is sitting in there. When I open the door the intruder turns and I realize my boss Gerald has come for a visit. I guess he couldn't wait for the Thursday meeting to get his criticism out. This is one of the downsides of being located 20 minutes from company headquarters.

"1:03," he says, "I see that even a lost package isn't enough to give you a sense of urgency. Still up for late lunches."

"A lost package can't be the only reason your here Gerald," I say.

"You're right," he says. "Though this lost package happens to belong to the future son-in-law of one of the board members. This has gone to the very top. One or two more lost packages like this and you had better start prepping your resume."

"We're not the only warehouse having issues with lost packages," I say. I know this because we have an annual warehouse managers weekend retreat and everyone complains about this.

"Other warehouses are not your problem," he says. "This warehouse is the one you are held accountable for, and we are losing packages right and left. Your name is now known to the CEO and not in a positive light."

He leans forward so that I can begin to smell his cologne.

"I'm giving you a deadline to work out this issue with lost packages. You have 2 weeks. Figure it out or find another job."

He stands up without waiting to see if I accept the deadline and leaves the room. If he was driving a Corvette you could probably hear the tires peel out of the parking lot.

Judy walks in.

"Oh dang," she says. "Well this is a bit late, but we found the package. It went out on the wrong truck. The driver just called and is bringing it back now."
