You've spent the last 2/5/20 years honing your skills as a developer and suddenly generative AI comes onto the scene and threatens to render your carefully collected skills obsolete within the next few years. You know you need to make the jump into AI programming, but how, and where do you start?

I'm going to give you a short answer. A baby step. But still, a great first step.

Learn [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

Most of the time when new languages arise on the scene, I wait for them to gain some traction in the community (at least 5  years) before I spend my time learning them. Having studied Latin and Ancient Greek, I'm not overly eager to become an enthusiast of yet another dead language. But something about Chris Lattner's new language Mojo has sparked my interest.

I first encountered Lattner when I was studying the [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) language. I loved the elegant mixture of functional programming concepts with the practicality of object-oriented support. I heard that he had moved on from Apple, first to Tesla, then to Google, and at that point I lost track of his career. Recently I learned that he was co-founding a new company called [Modular](https://www.modular.com/), and I couldn't help but dig in a bit to see what they were doing. A lot, it turns out.

At the heart of the Modular strategy is to create a new programming language that will become the core of the new wave of the AI/ML rollercoaster we're all about to go on. Similar to what Anders Hejlsberg did with TypeScript where he build a superset language to JavaScript which could capture the thriving community behind JavaScript, Lattner and the Modular team have created a superfast language, [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo), which is a superset of Python, the beloved language of the AI/ML community. Mojo allows developers to interop with any existing Python libraries (which is the true strength of the Python dominance in the machine learning community).

If you're on Apple Silicon like me, it's only just now possible to download the language and start to play around on your own machine. If you're on Linux or Windows you've been able to do it for awhile already. So go ahead, start your AI journey today!
