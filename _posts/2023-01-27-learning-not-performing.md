Each of us has a a gift, which we tend to devalue because it comes easy to us, while we look at the gifts of others and wish they were ours.

> “And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.” - [King Solomon](https://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/ECC+4.html)

In software this manifests as us comparing ourself to the “Alpha Dev” who can compare and contrast three hashing algorithms for any situtation. This leads us to trying to play catch up to their knowledge instead of experimenting and growing our own knowledge.

Knowledge was made to be acquired via play, hands-on experimenting (kids and baby animals know this instinctively). Yet most of the world, as it grows up, enters classrooms where all human distinctions are cut away and the only thing which matters is time to mastery of the single subject being studied. By the time we graduate college, this way of thinking is so engrained into us, we don’t even know there are other options.

We join a team. We watch the tech lead. We see their PR submissions and wonder how could we ever achieve their breadth of knowledge. Over time, we copy them and indeed begin to look a bit like them. Eventually, they get a better job offer, and we take their job, the cycle begins again, with us resetting our sites on the next person ahead of us in knowledge. Until we get disillusioned and settle in for whatever we’ve achieved and ride out our careers to retirement.

## KPI and GPA?

We tend to build our performance around how we measure ourselves. Usually the measurements we use for ourselves are simply the measurements others give to us. Often these are 3 letter words like KPI and GPA.

The Bible gives us a different measurement. It says that whatever we do, we are to do it for the Lord and NOT for man. For it is from the Lord that we receive our inheritance as our reward.

Once, I took a 14 hour flight to a quarterly meeting. In the first meeting, a spreadsheet was displayed on a projector to evaluate how our team had performed. The sheet looked familiar, I couldn't place it at first, and then I did. I had seen this sheet about 3 months ago. Someone had emailed it to us, we'd taken a look and then our priorities shifted and we forgot about it like so many other such spreadsheets that had passed our way before. 

But over the next 4 days, our team was grilled line by line on our progress for a set of measurements we had no idea we were being measured on.

I would suggest to you that you’re not really being measured by KPIs, or GPAs. Even in your own company. Yes, you can get fired (or fail out of school) if you don’t meet whatever arbitrary standards are set for you, but there's a different standard you are being measured on. This is the one that matters.

Here are some things I think are on the standard:

- Did you bring hope to your meetings this quarter?
- How much have you learned and actually enjoyed learning?
- What did you do with excellence this quarter?

I have decided to change my personal measurement away from KPI and GPA. I know others will measure me on those, but for myself I’m going to begin using LPA - Learning Points Achieved. Learning points can be achieved 2 ways - by learning something myself, or by teaching someone else. 

I also consider that teaching someone else is more valuable than learning something myself, partly because now two of us can do the same thing, and also because maybe the first time I really learned something was when I correctly taught it. If I’m competing with everyone around me, where is my motivation to teach others? If my value is based on knowing things they don’t, how will I ever have a desire to teach them?
