Whenever a promising technology lands in the tech world, startups and investments flock to it like geese fighting over crumbs from a passing child. For those of us who have grown up in the industry we view these periods of mass hysteria partly with a sigh as we know some bubble will soon collapse, but we also wonder what will the hysteria do to the industry. Hysteria is rarely unfounded. When the Internet arrived (developed as ARPANET about 20 years earlier), hysteria followed, but after the rubble of the dotcom fiasco, Amazon, Google, Paypal, and others emerged, seemingly unscathed, and they began to build the future upon which the hysteria had been founded. I'll forgo the diatribe on social networks, chatbots, blockchain, etc, each billed as the next big thing, each taking thousands of startups to the grave, yet each leaving a marked impact on the course of our future.

A few years ago, App Marketplaces became the next big thing, promising to reduce prices by introducing healthy competition and enabling economies of scale previously available only to tech giants. They began to add a quiet but impactful change to our lives. As a Digital Creator, I can pay only a few dollars for a graphic design template from Canva and ship a high quality book cover or social media post. As a Cloud Architect, I can pull in a fully configured SASS solution directly to my cloud deployment. The list goes on.

In 2021, I decided to join a promising Marketplace startup incubated within [Delhivery Logistics](https://www.delhivery.com/). We were setting out to build a logistics marketplace where the behemoth that is a logistics software system could be broken down into a series of individual apps, allowing smaller players in the logistics ecosystem to assemble a world-class software pipeline at a fraction of the cost.

We launched internally in early 2022 and made our public debut with the [OS1 Logistics Platform](https://getos1.com/) earlier this year. Whenever I told people what I was working on, I got a reaction along the lines of this: "Cool! Marketplaces are the future for sure." It felt good to be working on the cutting edge. That is, until a few months ago when the mass of startups began to make traction with the large language models pioneered by Google and OpenAI. The hysteria moved on to AI. 

Lots of companies have been deeply invested in AI for the past 10 years as the giant gears of the machine learning revolution have turned in the background behind all major software platforms. For example, our own company sports deep competancy in AI-based address resolution and validation in India, surpassing even the accuracy of Google for Indian addresses.

As this current wave of AI frenzy passes, we will see AI begin to fit into various industries and provide enhancements in much the same way online payments and social networks have enhanced the Internet, but never replaced it. AI is like a toddler, running around at full speed, but it needs to be directed somewhere. In each industry, the established systems will use AI to enhance their capabilities, but in most cases they will not be entirely replaced by AI (at least not this decade).

The marketplace concept remains a powerful one. I am excited to see how AI enhances it in the next few years but I believe that at the heart of innovation there will always be humans, and few concepts are better than the marketplace for harnessing the creativity of thousands of talented developers and allowing them to collectively deliver a mass-market product at a cost affordable to the masses.

So no, AI won't kill Marketplaces, but it has helped to remove the spotlight of hysteria from them, and for that I'm thankful.
