Let's say we're building an app for kids getting started in the babysitting business. In addition to supporting traditional input, we want to let them take paper notes to save data into the app.

There are lots of image processing options in the cloud these days, but for this post, we'll confine ourselves to the OCR offering from Azure. OCR stands for "Optical Character Recognition", which means we're going to be extracting text from an image. OCR can work with both traditional printed text as well as hand-written text.

We'll use the following image to demonstrate the process:
