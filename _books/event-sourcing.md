## What's this Book about?

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural concept which can be hard to understand, but yields game-changing results when correctly applied. I've taken the core concepts of Event Sourcing and packaged them in a fast-paced business-novel format to help you internalize these components before you start getting lost in code examples.
