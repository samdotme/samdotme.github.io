I pour the diner coffee into the small white mug. I don't even like diner coffee that much but coming here helps me think. Even better if Lily is here, which today she is. I suppose every couple has a few of these kinds of meetings during their lives. The ones where you feel a major life change is coming, but hasn't hit yet.

"Are you going to quit?" Lily asks as she stirs sugar into her coffee?

"If I quit, we won't be able to keep Jenny at All Saints and she'll have to try out all over again for the volleyball team, not to mention make a whole new set of friends. I don't want to do that to her right before she transitions to college."

"That's true," says Lily, "but if we explain it to her, I'm sure she'll understand. Plus, who's to say you won't find another job in a few months that will let her finish high school there?"

"I guess it would be easier to find a job now than if I get fired. But either way, what track record do I have to show for a future management job? I mismanaged a warehouse and got fired. Who will want to hire me?"

"You know you're not mismanaging the warehouse," she says firmly. "Every other manager in the company is having the exact same problems as you. You have just managed to become the scapegoat."

"You and I know that," I say, "But what potential employer will believe that. That's everyone's story."

She shrugs. 

"Well, what do you want to do? Quit now and start looking for a job or wait two weeks and get fired?"

I drink the coffee a little too fast and it spills on my shirt.

"What if we can fix the problem? What if I don't have to quit or get fired but we can actually fix the problem? That's what I really want."

She gets that conspiratorial look. Then she leans in across the table. "I like it. Today is Thursday. I'll get an AirBnb for Friday and Saturday. We'll bring the kids and we'll work out a strategy. You can try it for a week. If at the end of the week you see positive change, bring it to your management and see if the two week deadline is lifted. If not, you quit."

Eggs benedict always tastes better after you've made up your mind about something.

The Thursday warehouse managers' meeting that day is awful, maybe even worse than I expected. Gerald uses every trick he knows to make sure everyone knows that my mismanagement was the cause of the lost package. He even asks probing questions about how could I not know it went out on the wrong truck, to which my only answer is that the software doesn't tell me, which he points out sounds like I'm shirking responsibility.

Lily has to spend 20 minutes talking me out of quitting all over again and to stick to the plan, once I find out that she already reserved the AirBnb I back down. The kids of course are thrilled and keep coming out of their rooms asking me which items they'll need. Max is 10 and still brings stuffed animals. Jenny is 17 and starting her senior year of high school in the fall. Lily and I try to watch a movie, but the kids have too many questions and finally we get tired of pausing the movie every two minutes.

Max: "Dad, can I bring 3 stuffies?"

Me: "No, two is plenty."

Jenny: "Is there anywhere to workout in the rental?"

Me: "Are you kidding me? Just go for a run in the morning."

Lily: "Actually there is a small workout set downstairs.

Me: "How much did you spend on this place?"

Lily: "If it saves your job, any price is worth it."

Max: "Dad, can I bring a bb gun?"

Jenny: "Do you really think the four of us sitting in a room for a few hours can figure out how to solve dad's work problem?

Me: This is probably more of a life lesson than a real chance. We just want you kids to see that when we run into hard things in life we shouldn't give up easily.

Lily: If that's all the confidence you have in it, then maybe I shouldn't have reserved it.

Lily gets up from the couch and goes to our room. She closes the door a bit louder than normal. A minute later she open the door and calls out, "I also invited Uncle Rick."

The kids squeal with excitement. I groan. Not that I don't like Uncle Rick. Everyone likes Uncle Rick. It's just, he's not really the guy that you want around while everyone discusses your work failures. He went to school for one of those computer engineering degrees. When I first met Lily we were seniors in college and he was just starting as a freshman. I thought he would be one of those nerds that can't hold a conversation and considers himself superior to everyone else because he learned to take the derivative of function when he was 15 by watching YouTube videos.

On one of the first visits to meet Lily's family over Christmas break he was back from college and I learned that Rick was coming over. I was one of those overly confident business students you meet, that owns two newly bought suits and alternates them between interviews. I was planning on the typical, "graduate and then I'll work two years for experience and go back for my MBA." When I met Rick I could tell that he was a lot smarter than I was, but I couldn't tell if he knew it. He seemed genuinely interested in what I was studying and my future plans that I actually forgot to ask him about his.

Over the years he has worked at several respectable tech companies, I think on their infosec teams. These days he seems to often be in between jobs and yet never short on money. I know this because he buys the kids more Christmas presents than we do. He even got Lily a new iPhone last Christmas, which was kinda nice because she had an almost brand new one already that I inherited.

I go into the bedroom and walk over to the sink to brush my teeth. Lily is quiet. I almost think she's asleep until I hear her stir.

"If you don't believe you can do it, I believe you can."

A few minutes later when I get to bed I can hear her deep breathing. I wish I could go to sleep so easily.
