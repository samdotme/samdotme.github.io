"For a lot of developers right now, getting into AI is like a kid at a playground trying to jump onto a spinning merry-go-round. Most of them are jumping, and getting knocked right back to the ground," said a friend as we talked about AI.

My friend has started an AI company that is actually getting traction. But for most developers I talk to, the conversation around AI swirls back and forth between ethics and whether it's useful for coding. Everyone can talk about those things, but so few people seem to know how to implement it into their every day projects.

When I was studying Chinese right after college, I noticed that it was so much easier to take a break and read about Chinese history instead of continuing to review the characters I didn't know. I felt justified that I was still learning, but I wasn't growing in the area I actually needed to. Reading an interesting book was simply easier than pushing my brain on another flash card.

And so with AI, most of us developers have developed a series of stock conversations around the topic which make us look like we have something to say, but we actually are incapable of using it for anything.

I want to change that. This field is inherently learnable. But just like learning a new language, there is no shortcut around doing the work. I've decided to go on a quest to uncover the path to take a traditional C#/Python/Java/[your framework] developer and lead them through a valley of hard work to the mountain of being able to implement AI solutions.

Let's face it, anyone can call an API. What will set apart AI-weaponized developers of the future will be the ability to intuit how to transform large sets of data into the useful outputs people will pay for.
